# SnakeGame

This is a simple implementation of a Snake Game in Java using the Swing library for the graphical user interface. This implementation includes a basic game loop, keyboard controls, and collision detection.

This Snake Game uses a JFrame for the graphical user interface and handles user input through the KeyListener interface. The game loop is managed by a Timer, and the snake movement, collision detection, and rendering are all handled within the game logic. The snake grows longer when it eats the food, and the game ends if the snake collides with itself.
